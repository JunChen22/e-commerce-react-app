Q: getting error in frontend
    "Error: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource."

A: it's CORS issue, need to add CORS configuration in the backend.
    in global, you can change it in security config
    or in controller level, you can use @CrossOrigin annotation.
    @CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:3000")  // assuming your Next.js runs on port 3000



Q: changes made to backend and the data not changing while postman getting the right data.

A: it's been cached in next js. check .next folder. ./.next/cache/fetch-cache

  can delete it or use { cache: 'no-store' }) in development while fetching.
